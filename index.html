        <ol>
          <li> <b>Chance to Have Your Voice Heard</b> Some of the biggest issues facing our country today can be solved by putting the right people in office. Social issues that NEED to be changed start with your ballot. Let the world know that you want change. </li>
          <li> <b>Democracy Ceases to Exist if No One Votes</b> Without your vote, you leave the fate of the country to a small percent. A Democracy is only as good as the people who are in it. Don't leave the fate of our country in the hands of a couple million</li>
          <li> <b>Be Apart of Something Bigger Than Yourself</b> Even if the policys and decisions don't impact your day to day, vote to change life for others. Vote to help your neighbor, vote to help your friend, vote to help your country.</li>
          <li> <b>Your Vote MATTERS</b> A common misconception for young voters is the idea that one vote won't change the election or my vote won't matter. This is a very dangerous mindset to have due to the fact that if everyone thinks that,  then no one ends up voting. If you're a blue voter in a red state or a red voter in a blue state voice your opinion, speak up let them know you are there and not afraid to fight for what you believe is right. Do not surrender your voice. </li>
          <li> <b>Local and State Elections Will Have a Direct Impact on your Community</b> Another fatal flaw of voting is the lack of participation at the local level. Presidential voting is extremlely important, but so are the local elections. Vote for mayors, school representatives, congressman, police, etc to solve issues that will directly impact your day to day.</li>
          <li> <b>THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON THE CHOICES MADE TODAY</b> Probably one of the most important reasons on this list. What we choose to do today will define the who we will be as a country for years to come. Wouldn't you wanna say in your future?</li>

      <p> Above are two graphs. The first shows voter turnout for the 2016 presidential election and the second shows the 2018 midterm election which had the highest turnout rate since 1914. To put into perspective, The United States has a population of roughly 328 million people. That means roughly a third of Americans did not vote during the presidential Election. That is abysmal, and our "RECORD" number of voter turnout is BARELY half. We have got to do better. Change will not happen unless each and every person fights for a better tommorrow. It's Gonna take all of us so GO VOTE!!!!!!!</p>
